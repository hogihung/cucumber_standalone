= Standalone Cucumber Test Suite

== Introduction

This is my implemenation of the standalone-cucumber solution provided by:
https://github.com/thuss/standalone-cucumber

*Note: I had issues running with Firefox, so updated so Selenium will use Chrome.*

* features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb : generic steps that apply to all features
* features/step_definintions/[feature]_steps.rb : steps specific to an individual feature file
